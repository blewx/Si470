SLV 2010 TUS:

GIVEN

- participant time (in daily hours already) * participation rate = hours_per_day
- note: the report just calls it 'average hours' without flagging it as only participant time, but we can tell it is because even activities with low participation have high average time
- given for female and male separately - to find total average, used 55.3% female, 44.7% male ratio (for population 10+, p. 19 of report)

RELEVANT TABLES

- gráfico 6, p. 22: participant TIME for all activities
	-> note: the numbers are hard to read and could not find the original data from the listed DIGESTYC source
	-> although the heading of the graph is 'unpaid activities,' it includes a 'travel and productive work' category (productive work refers to paid work - assumed from p. 3, third paragraph of report), so I used this as the 'paid work' time and the numbers make sense  -->  paid work participant time is also on p.20, but there is no participant rate so I didn't use that one

- gráfico 42, p. 49: participation RATE for all activities

NOTES

- 'actividades de esparcimiento' translates to 'outdoor activities' in Google Translate, but this category probably means all leisure activities 

- 'travel and productive work' is assumed to refer to paid work and its associated travel, not travel for all 14 categories - so I renamed this category as 'paid work and associated travel'
(reason for this assumption: report indicates that paid work time includes commuting time)

- part B) of 'SLV_TUS_2010_all_calculations' checks the main data with data from separate graphs (which is only provided for certain activities). Most of the times line up, but there is a noticeable discrepancy for 'educational activities' -> unsure of the reason. 'SLV_TUS_2010_main_data' uses the time from the main graph.
